        <h1>Dance Career</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Timothy O'Donnell is a dancer, choreographer, graphic artist, art director, and photographer who hails from Wauchope, Australia. He is currently Director of MBII and choreographer-in-residence at Milwaukee Ballet</p>
            <p>His choreographic style is physically explosive, equal parts intricate and intelligent, impressive and interesting. His works ruminate on issues that affect us all, from
            the complexities of love, to methods of communication, to the intrinsic desire to express and rebel, to body image.
            He holds up a mirror to the audience and invites them to think about their own idiosyncrasies.</p>
            <p>O'Donnell commenced his dance training with his mother, Francessca O'Donnell, at her ballet school at age seven. 
            He eventually joined The Australian Ballet School where he won several awards, including the Jacob Bloch Memorial Award
            and first place in The Australian Institute of Classical Dance's national choreographic competition.</p>
            <p>As a dancer, O'Donnell performed multiple principal and soloist roles for West Australian Ballet in works including
            <em>Coppelia, Cinderella, The Red Shoes, The Nutcracker</em> and <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet.</em> O'Donnell was also fortunate enough
            to work with celebrated national and international artists such as Paul Lightfoot, Petr Zuska, Simon Dow, Matjash 
            Morzewski, and Ivan Cavallari. In 2007, he won the "Outstanding Performance by a Male DAncer" award at the 
            West Australian Dance Awards.</p>
