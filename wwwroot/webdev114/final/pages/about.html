            <h1>About Tim</h1>
            <p>Timothy O'Donnell is a dancer, choreographer, graphic artist, art director, and photographer who hails from Wauchope, Australia. He is currently Co-Director of MBII and choreographer-in-residence at Milwaukee Ballet</p>
            <p>O'Donnell made Milwaukee Ballet his home in 2012, joining the company as a dancer and choreographer-in-residence. This was a full-circle moment
            for him, as Michael Pink's <em>Dracula</em>, which he saw at age 15, was a major influence on his
            path to becoming a choreographer.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Dance Career</h2>
            <p>O'Donnell commenced his dance training with his mother, Francessca O'Donnell, at her ballet school at age seven. 
            He eventually joined The Australian Ballet School where he won several awards, including the Jacob Bloch Memorial Award
            and first place in The Australian Institute of Classical Dance's national choreographic competition.</p>
            <p>As a dancer, O'Donnell performed multiple principal and soloist roles for West Australian Ballet in works including
            <em>Coppelia, Cinderella, The Red Shoes, The Nutcracker</em> and <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet.</em> O'Donnell was also fortunate enough
            to work with celebrated national and international artists such as Paul Lightfoot, Petr Zuska, Simon Dow, Matjash 
            Morzewski, and Ivan Cavallari. In 2007, he won the "Outstanding Performance by a Male DAncer" award at the 
            West Australian Dance Awards.</p>
            <p>At Milwaukee Ballet, he has danced in roles including Marcello in <em>La Boheme</em>, Verdigris (the green stepsister)
            in <em>Cinderella</em>, and the title character in <em>Dorian Gray.</em></p>

            <h2>Choreography</h2>
            <p>Timothy's choreographic style is physically explosive, equal parts intricate and intelligent, impressive and interesting. His works ruminate on issues that affect us all, from
            the complexities of love, to methods of communication, to the intrinsic desire to express and rebel, to body image.
            He holds up a mirror to the audience and invites them to think about their own idiosyncrasies.</p>
            <p>In 2009, he entered Milwaukee Ballet's
            International Choreographic Competition, <em>Genesis</em>, where he was awarded first place and the Audience Choice Award for his work,
            <em>The Games We Play</em>. He returned in 2010 to create another work, <em>Bolero-Let There Be Light.</em></p>
            <p>Since then, his choeographic highlights have included becoming a co-director of Ludwig, working for major dance events such as
            the Australian Dance Awards, and appearing as a choreographer on <em>So You Think You Can Dance-Australia.</em></p>
            <p>Since becoming choreographer-in-residence at Milwaukee Ballet, he has staged three world premiers in Milwaukee: 
            <em>Children of the Wall, Talk to Me, The Sixth Sin, Sans Pleurer</em> and <em>More Truth Than Poetry.</em></p>

            <h2>Other Interests</h2>
            <p>O'Donnell is also a force behind-the-scenes. He serves as an artistic advisor to the Milwaukee Ballet marketing department,
            art directing photo shoots, producing graphic design, and creating promotional videos.</p>
            <p>O'Donnell is an admired teacher at Milwaukee Ballet School &amp; Academy. He also teaches private lessons and choreographs 
            pieces for competition.</p>
