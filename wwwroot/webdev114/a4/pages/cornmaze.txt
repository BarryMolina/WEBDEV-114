It's a corn maze! Its ok if you get lost, we'll probably find you! Put your wits to
the test while trying to solve a maze.. from within the maze. Its like Harry Potter 
except everybody survives. But please, don't cheat. Its just not cool. For an added 
challenge, wait till it gets dark. That's the only way to become a true corn maze
champion.

We put alot of effort into creating a fresh new layout every year, so keep coming back!
If nothing else, you'll get a bit of fresh air and some much needed exercise.
