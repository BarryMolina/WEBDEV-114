        <h3>Apple Orchard</h3>
        <img src="../images/appletree.jpg" alt="Apple Tree" class="left">
        <p>Our apple orchard supports a wide variety of different types of apples, including
Honey Crisp, Gala, McIntosh, and Granny Smith. They all mature at different times 
during the season, so be sure that you inquire ahead of time if you prefer a particular
one.</p>
        <p>Upon your arrival, our volunteers will direct you to the best picking location so that 
you may always pick the freshest and ripest apples for that time of season. If you're in
a hurry, pre-picked apples are also available for purchase inside.</p>

        <h3>Pumpkin Patch</h3>
        <img src="../images/pumpkinpatch.jpg" alt="Pumpkin Patch" class="right">
        <p>Looking forward to Halloween? We sure are. Celebrate in style with a hand carved
Jack 'O Lantern from one of our large plump carving pumpkins. While you're out here, 
pick up a couple pie pumpkins as well for farm-fresh pumpkin pie.</p>
        <p>You can pick from one of our pre-harvested pumpkins or get the full fall experience
by venturing out into the pumpkin patch yourself. Kids love choosing their future
masterpiece from among the leaves and vines, while you'll just be happy they're
out of the house and not looking at their screens for once.</p>
