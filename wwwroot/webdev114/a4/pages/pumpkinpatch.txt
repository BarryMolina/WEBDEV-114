Looking forward to Halloween? We sure are. Celebrate in style with a hand carved
Jack 'O Lantern from one of our large plump carving pumpkings. While you're out here, 
pick up a couple pie pumpkins as well for farm-fresh pumpkin pie. 

You can pick from one of our pre-harvested pumkins or get the full fall experience
by venturing out into the pumpkin patch yourself. Kids love choosing their future
masterpiece from among the leaves and vines, while you'll just be happy they're
out of the house and not looking at their screens for once.
