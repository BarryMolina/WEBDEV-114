            <p><em>Barry's Berry Farm</em> started with our founder, Barry Molina, and his dream of
            having his own destination farm. He always loved apple picking and hay rides, 
            and decided to share his passion with others. Now Barry's Berry Farm has multiple 
            products and activities available, with more being added every year.</p>
