        <h3>Hay Rides</h3>
        <img src="../images/hayride.jpg" alt="Hay Ride" class="left">
        <p>What's more fun than bouncing along on a bale of hay in a wagon drawn behind 
        two beautiful Clydesdales? Not much, which is why you should come galavanting around the country 
side with us on a classic hay ride. This quintessential country experience is not to
be missed.</p>
        <p>While being fun and relaxing, the hay ride is perfect to get the youngsters back in 
touch with nature. Step away from the hustle and bustle of the city and sit back
and enjoy the fall season the way it was meant to be.</p>

        <h3>Corn Maze</h3>
        <img src="../images/cornmaze.png" alt="Corn Maze" class="right">
        <p>It's a corn maze! Its ok if you get lost, we'll probably find you! Put your wits to
the test while trying to solve a maze.. from within the maze. Its like Harry Potter 
except everybody survives. But please, don't cheat. Its just not cool. For an added 
challenge, wait till it gets dark.</p>
        <p>We put alot of effort into creating a fresh new layout every year, so keep coming back!
If nothing else, you'll get a bit of fresh air and some much needed exercise.</p>
