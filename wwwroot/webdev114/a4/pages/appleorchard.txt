Our apple orchard supports a wide variety of different types of apples, including
Honey Crisp, Gala, McIntosh, and Granny Smith. They all mature at different times 
during the season, so be sure that you inquire ahead of time if you prefer a particular
one. 

Upon your arrival, our volunteers will direct you to the best picking location so that 
you may always pick the freshest and ripest apples for that time of season. If you're in
a hurry, pre-picked apples are also available for purchase inside.
