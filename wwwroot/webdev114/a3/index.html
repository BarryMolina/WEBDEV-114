        <h1>Is Vaping Bad For You?</h1>
        <h2>Studies Show Vaping May Cause Lung and Tissue Damage</h2>
        <p>Vaping may not be the healthy cigarette alternative it was originally claimed to be. Although research is currently mixed, vaping has been linked to several deaths and hundreds of otherwise healthy people ending up in emergency rooms with lung damage. The culprit appears to be the vape juice itself, even without any nicotine added. </p>

        <h3>Kids are using it</h3>
        <p>Compared to other traditional tobacco products, vaping and e-cigarettes have grown in popularity among youth. The U.S surgon general reported in 2015 that highschool student e-cigarette use is up 900 percent. This popularity can be attributed to the belief that vaping is less harmful than traditional tobacco producets, that the per-use cost of using a vape is lower than cigarettes, and that vape cartriges often have enticing flavors that appeal to younger users.</p>

        <h3>It's in the Juice</h3>
        <p>Because vaping is supposed to avoid all the tar and chemicals associated with cigarette smoke, the deaths and hospital runs caused by e-cig use was originally dubbed &ldquo;mysterious&rdquo;. Studies have since shown that vape juice can cause lung damage all on its own. Researcher Farrah Kheradmand says that vape juice contains propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin. She says, <blockquote><strong>&ldquo;It has been manipulated to a point where vapers feel they get a very good hit in their lungs. It's the same kind of feeling as a cigarette smoke inhalation gives you - that you feel like something is really going down to your lungs.&rdquo;</strong></blockquote>However, the vape juice seems to be handicapping immune cells in the lungs, according to Kheradmand's experiments with lab mice. Apparently, the ingredients in vape juice have been approved by the FDA, but for an entirly different use, to disolve and deliver medication.

        <h3>It causes Popcorn Lung</h3>
        <p>Another chemical that is sometimes found in e-cig flavors is Diacetyl, a buttery-flavored chemical. Diacetyl has been linked to bronchiolitis obliterans, a serious lung disease also known as popcorn lung. It is so called because workers in microwave popcorn factories were getting this disease from inhaling this chemical in a way similar to how it is breathed in through vapes. The chemical was being used to provide a buttery flavor to the popcorn but its use has since been discontinued. The symptoms include a dry cough that won't go away, shortness of breath, wheezing, headaches, and fever, among others. Diacetyl causes scars to form in the tiny air sacs in your lungs that make your airways thick and narrow. The disease can't be cured, only kept from getting worse.</p>
